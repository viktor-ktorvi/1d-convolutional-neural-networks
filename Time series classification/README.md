# Time series classification

A simple model to classify a noisy time series into one of three classes: sin, square or sawtooth wave.

The model consist of two convolutional layers and three fully connected layers and achives an accurracy of around 99% training on a Core i5 CPU for about 15 seconds as it is a relatively simple problem.
